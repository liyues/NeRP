# 1. Overview

This repository provides the PyTorch code for our TNNLS 2022 papar [NeRP: Implicit Neural Representation Learning With Prior Embedding for Sparsely Sampled Image Reconstruction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9788018).

by [Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/), John Pauly, Lei Xing

We propose an implicit <B>Ne</B>ural <B>R</B>epresentation learning methodology with <B>P</B>rior embedding (<B>NeRP</B>) to reconstruct a computational image from sparsely sampled measurements. The method differs fundamentally from previous deep learning-based image reconstruction approaches in that NeRP exploits the internal information in an image prior, and the physics of the sparsely sampled measurements to produce a representation of the unknown subject. No large-scale data is required to train the NeRP except for a prior image and sparsely sampled measurements. We demonstrate that NeRP is a general methodology that generalizes to different imaging modalities including 2D / 3D CT and MRI.

# 3. Instructions for Running Code


## 2D CT Reconstruction Experiment

The experiments of 2D CT image reconstruction use the 2D parallel-beam geometry.

### Step 1: Prior embedding

Represent 2D image by implicit network network. The prior image ([pancs_4dct_phase1.npz](./data/ct_data/pancs_4dct_phase1.npz): phase-1 image of a 10-phase 4D pancreas CT data) is provided under [data/ct_data](./data/ct_data) folder.

```
python train_image_regression.py --config configs/image_regression.yaml
```

### Step 2: Network training

Reconstruct 2D CT image from sparsely sampled projections. The reconstruction target image ([pancs_4dct_phase6.npz](./data/ct_data/pancs_4dct_phase6.npz): phase-6 image of a 10-phase 4D pancreas CT data) is provided under [data/ct_data](./data/ct_data) folder.

With prior embedding:
```
python train_ct_recon.py --config configs/ct_recon.yaml --pretrain
```

Without prior embedding:
```
python train_ct_recon.py --config configs/ct_recon.yaml
```

## 3D CT Reconstruction Experiment

The experiments of 3D CT image reconstruction use the 3D cone-beam geometry.

### Step 1: Prior embedding

Represent 3D image by implicit network network. The prior image ([pancs_4dct_phase1.npz](./data/ct_data/pancs_4dct_phase1.npz): phase-1 image of a 10-phase 4D pancreas CT data) is provided under [data/ct_data](./data/ct_data) folder.

```
python train_image_regression_3d.py --config configs/image_regression_3d.yaml
```

### Step 2: Network training

Reconstruct 3D CT image from sparsely sampled projections. The reconstruction target image ([pancs_4dct_phase6.npz](./data/ct_data/pancs_4dct_phase6.npz): phase-6 image of a 10-phase 4D pancreas CT data) is provided under [data/ct_data](./data/ct_data) folder.

With prior embedding:
```
train_ct_recon_3d.py --config configs/ct_recon_3d.yaml --pretrain
```

Without prior embedding:
```
python train_ct_recon_3d.py --config configs/ct_recon_3d.yaml
```

### Step 3: Image inference

Output and save the reconstruted 3D image after training is done at a specified iteration step.

With prior embedding:
```
python test_ct_recon_3d.py --config configs/ct_recon_3d.yaml --pretrain --iter 2000
```

Without prior embedding:
```
python test_ct_recon_3d.py --config configs/ct_recon_3d.yaml --iter 2000
```
